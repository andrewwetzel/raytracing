# Ionospheric Ray Tracing

This project simulates the propagation of radio waves through the Earth's ionosphere. It provides a simple web application to visualize ray tracing calculations and will eventually incorporate various methods and more complex visualizations.

## Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to develop a tool for simulating and visualizing the path of radio waves as they travel through the ionosphere. This can be used for various applications, including:

*   Understanding radio wave propagation
*   Predicting communication link performance
*   Analyzing ionospheric effects on satellite navigation systems

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to have Python and Flask installed. You can then clone the repository and run the web application.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/raytracing.git
cd raytracing/apps
python app.py
```

## Documentation

The `docs` folder contains relevant research papers and a LaTeX file with a list of key equations used in the simulations.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
